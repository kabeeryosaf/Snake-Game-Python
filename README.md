## About the Game

Snake is a classic game where the player controls a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. The game is played on a grid, and the player's goal is to eat food while avoiding running into the line.

### Built With

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Pygame

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

## How to Play

The game starts with a snake of length 1. The player controls the snake's direction using the arrow keys. The snake moves in the direction of the arrow key pressed. The player must eat food that appears on the screen to grow the snake. The game ends when the snake runs into the screen border or into itself.
